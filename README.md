I'm back in italy and I relized that all my friends are now working adults, therefore they work until 5pm and I'm basically alone until then.
So here I am, writing a a benchmark for AI and Multi agent system poject (best course in DTU so far) in GO.
You are probably asking, **Why the F*** in GO?**.
I though a lot about it, and python would have been the best choice by far. Easy to code, everyone knows it and this project doesn't even require performance, so why? 
Honestly I thought that a bit of GO on my Github will look better than python and if you are going to contribute to this repo you can say that you have GO experience so you're welcome.

If you have read this you probably have a lot of free time so I can suggest you to start to find some hobbies like death diving, for some reason my instagram feeds are full of that.
